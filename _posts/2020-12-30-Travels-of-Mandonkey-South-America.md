South America is my favourite continent. From tropical rainforests of Brazil to the arid deserts of Argentina; the glorious beach coastline of Colombia to the glaciers of Chile, the sheer variety it offers is unrivalled by anywhere else on Earth.

My love affair with South America began back in 2004, when I nervously planned my first round the world trip. In truth, other than a family trip to Egypt, it was my first trip out of Europe. 
My parents tried endlessly to convince me that this was a bad idea: it was unsafe, it wouldn't help my career prospects, I would end up hating it. 
Just to help matters, my first stop was going to be Rio de Janeiro and my older brother helpfully bought a copy of the film "Cidade de Deus" (I actually love it, but it does nothing for Rio's reputation) for the whole family to watch a week before I was due to depart!
